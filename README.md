 ## How to use?

**Step 1 Download Python 3.6**

<br/>

**For WIndows**

- Visit the Python Downloads Page for Windows:
        Go to the official Python website's download section at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.

- Locate Python 3.6:
        Scroll down until you find Python 3.6. There might be several versions of 3.6.x. Choose the one you prefer or the latest within the 3.6 series.

- Download the Installer:
        Based on your Windows system type, download the appropriate installer:
            For 64-bit systems, download the "Windows x86-64 executable installer".
            For 32-bit systems, download the "Windows x86 executable installer".

- Run the Installer:
        Locate the installer you just downloaded and double-click to run it.
        Ensure you check the box that says "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" during the installation. This makes it easier to run Python from the command line.
        Choose "Install Now" to install Python with default settings, or "Customize installation" if you have specific preferences.

- Verify the Installation:
        After the installation, open the command prompt and type python --version. You should see Python 3.6.x as the output, confirming that Python 3.6 was installed successfully.

        Click on the "macOS 64-bit/32-bit installer" link to download the installer for Python 3.6.

- Run the Installer:
        Once downloaded, locate the installer file (usually in the Downloads folder) and double-click on it to run.

- Verify the Installation:
        After the installation, open Terminal and type python3.6 --version. You should get an output indicating the version is Python 3.6.x.
